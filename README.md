# YOLOv3-from-scratch

This project is a TensorFlow implementation of YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once, version 3) â€” a state-of-the-art real-time object detection model.
It detects multiple objects in images by predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in a single evaluation.

The model was implemented from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras, following the YOLOv3 architecture and anchor-based detection mechanism.
It includes utilities for preprocessing, model construction, target transformation, and result visualization.
